For speak purposes, I utilized Alexa Skills Kit to create a lambda function that would model the robot's responses after those in the show's episode (S1 E09). In the future, I will implement the ClarifAI API so that the robot will be able to use its camera to learn whether or not there is a human in front of it. If so, the butter bot will automatically engage in conversation, namely wondering what its purpose is in the world.`,
