const description = `After graduating from NYU with a B.A. in Economics, I decided to tap into my creative side and follow in my parents' entrepreneurial footsteps by launching a graphic design company. I learned so much during that time, but everything I created was static. Craving to expand my technical capabilities coupled with a desire to build dynamic apps and a love for languages, I became a software engineer. Presently, I'm working at Bloomberg LP creating Sell-Side analytics and championing diversity, equity, and inclusion.`
